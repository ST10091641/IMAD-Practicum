This Android application demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, and screen navigation in Kotlin to create a functional movie review manager with three distinct screens.  

 

The splash_main.xml screenshot below shows the layout of the application, I made use of two TextViews and one Imageview to display the logo. 

 

 

 

The figure below shows the Splash screen user interface. 

This is the welcoming/home screen of the movie review application. 

 

 

The figure below shows the kotlin code of the Main screen, it consists of one TextView, two Buttons and one ImageView. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The screenshot below shows the user interface of the Main screen. 

The second screen of the app uses two buttons, two textviews, and one imageview. 

As a user, you simply press the add movie button to add a movie. Thereafter you press the view reviews button to view the movie review of the added movie, simple to use. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The figure below shows the kotlin code for the Detalied View screen. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then the figure below shows the user interface of the detailed view screen.  

In the third and final screen the user will get a display of the list of movies, the director of the movie, the ratings as well as the comments. 

 

The Pseudocode below illustrates the steps of developing the program.
